The rose robin (Petroica rosea) is a small species of passerine bird native to Australia. 
It tends to feed in the tops of trees, with insects and spiders forming the bulk of its diet, most being caught while it is in flight.
Unlike other robins, it does not return to the same branch while foraging. 
Its prey consists of a variety of spiders and insects, including caterpillars, wasps, bugs such as cicadas and cinch bugs, beetles, weevils, flies and ants.
This rose robin was photographed in the Blue Mountains National Park, near Woodford, New South Wales.
